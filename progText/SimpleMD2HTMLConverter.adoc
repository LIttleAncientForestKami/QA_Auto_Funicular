# Prosty MD â†’ HTML / Simple Markdown to HTML converter

. Input: markdown file (with simple markup rules, outlined below).
. Output: equivalent HTML page.
. Your converter will get only text. No links, no media, no weirdness.
. It should cover bold, italics, bulleted and numbered lists and headers.

## Simple markdown file

----
*text within asterisks should be bolded*
_text within underscores should be italicized_

. starts a bullet list
. without numbers

1. if numbers are used
2. then it's a numbered list
4. even if numbers are not in order, make it ordered

# means header, number of hashes tells you which header, h1 - h6
----

## Resulting HTML file

. should have same HEAD, having UTF-8 as charset and "Converted Page" as title
. should have converted text in BODY tag
. should be a valid HTML 5 page (don't do strange things when converting and this should do).
