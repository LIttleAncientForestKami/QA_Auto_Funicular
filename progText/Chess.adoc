# Program rozgrywający partię szachów dla początkującego (komputer niech ma prostą sekwencję ruchów do wykonania) / Program which plays chess game for the beginner (computer should have simple sequence of moves)

* Computer playes one game, merely a sequence of moves, every single time
* Player chooses a piece
* Player then sees where his chosen piece can go

NOTE: bonus points if - for beginners - pieces in jeopardy are somehow marked.

[CAUTION]
.To GUI or not to GUI?

While it may be tempting to do this in console, I'd advise trying out anything graphical here. Reasons would be:

1. playability of the game
2. clarity of things shown for beginner
3. surprisingly, doing this in console would require quite severe amount of printing and scrolling, and showcasing pieces in danger requires colours - which requires hacking your own console or using Unicode. Not easy.

Nevertheless, I'm fine with console-based chess games. They are console-based, after all. ;-)
