# Oto plansza szachów, podaj zagrożone figury / You have a chess board, show threatened figures

Given a chess board noted in standard notation, return which pieces can be lost in next move (by both sides).

## Chess board notation

. White pieces start with W
. Black pieces start with B
. Each piece starts with first letter of it: K, Q, T, B, Kn, P. Kn is Knight.
. Position on a board is given per coordinates, A1 - H8. 

Example:

WK A1 -> white king on field A1.

Check for white if BQ is in column A or row 1 or in proper diagonal and can reach the king, or if BT are in same row / column without any pieces in between etc.

TIP: start with just the king. I'll accept that as minimum version of the program.
