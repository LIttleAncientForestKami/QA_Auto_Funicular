# Prosty walidator HTML 5 HEAD / Simple HTML 5 HEAD validator

Write a program that validates HTML `<HEAD>` tag for correctness according to HTML5 rules.

TIP: minimal valid header contains just `<title>` tag, if no such tag is detected by browsers it's added. Strange tags are simply ignored by browsers, feel free to do that too.

## Input methods

Please write three ways for user to pass you the tag content:

. from file by file name
. by typing it directly
. passing it as a String
