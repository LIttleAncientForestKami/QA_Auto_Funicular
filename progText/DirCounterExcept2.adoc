# j.w. + listę można robić ręcznie w programie (wybierz katalogi do…) / Write a program that counts directories except ones from list + directory list can be created manually in the program

Accept a path, return how many directories are in it. 

CAUTION: Windows and GNU/Linux or Mac systems use different path separators. Be mindful of it, your program should work cross-platforms!

Please also check a `forbidden.properties` file and exclude from counting all directories there.

So, directory with two subdirectories would return 2, but if both are in the properties file, it would return 0.

Additionally, allow the users to manually enter list of dirs NOT to be counted.
