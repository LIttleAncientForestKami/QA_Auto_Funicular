# Snake [gra] / Snake [Game]

* Game is played within rectangular area.
* Borders are impassable. 
* Snake grows after it eats something.
* Consummables appear randomly within the area.
* Snake has to be in constant motion.
* Snake dies if it collides with area border or with itself.
* Player controls the snake with arrow keys.

CAUTION: If player presses the arrow opposite to the direction the snake is moving in currently, nothing should happen. So, snake going left won't _reverse_ just cause right arrow was pressed.
