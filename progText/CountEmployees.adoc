# Wypisz liczbę pracowników stworzonych w systemie bez zewnętrznego licznika / Count employee objects WITHOUT internal counter.

* Create an Employee class.
* Have a counter for all employee objects (**NOT** external but inside that class).
* Each time you create an object of that class, you should increase that counter somehow.

TIP: was discussed during course already, (`main` method has it). :-)
