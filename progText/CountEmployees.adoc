# Wypisz liczbę pracowników stworzonych w systemie bez zewnętrznego licznika / Count employee objects WITHOUT internal counter.

* Create and Employee class.
* Have a counter for all employee objects (**NOT** external but inside that class).
* Each time you create an object of that class, you should increase that counter somehow.

Hint: was discussed during course already. :-)
