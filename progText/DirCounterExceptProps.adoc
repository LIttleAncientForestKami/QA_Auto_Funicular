# j.w. + poza takimi z listy (z pliku properties) / Write a program that counts directories except ones from list (list from properties file)

Accept a path, return how many directories are in it. 

CAUTION: Windows and GNU/Linux or Mac systems use different path separators. Be mindful of it, your program should work cross-platforms!

Please also check a `forbidden.properties` file and exclude from counting all directories there.

So, directory with two subdirectories would return 2, but if both are in the properties file, it would return 0.
