# Poker Hand Evaluator (You have five cards, what poker hand it is?)

Poker hands are nicely described https://www.pokerstars.eu/pl/poker/games/rules/hand-rankings/[at Poker Stars], site should be translatable.

It's enough if the program evaluates:

. Poker (Straight Flush) i Królewski Poker (Royal Flush)
. Kareta (Four of a Kind)
. Ful (Full House)
. Kolor (Flush)
. Strit (Straight)
. Trójka (Three of a Kind)
. Dwie pary (Two Pairs)
. Parę (Pair)

Program is to just tell the name of the hand and highlight cards that make it.
