# Oto plansza szachów, oblicz "pozycje szachowe" (liczbowa wartość białych i czarnych) / You have a chess board, calculate “chess positions” (numerical value of white and black figures)

Chess boards can be scored. What is on a board gives "points". Who has more points, wins. 

## Piece - Points

. Queen - 10
. Tower - 5
. Bishop - 3
. Knight - 2
. pawn - 1

TIP: King is priceless, not having it means there's no points in scoring... ;-)
