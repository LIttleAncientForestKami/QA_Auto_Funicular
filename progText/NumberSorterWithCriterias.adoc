# Number sorter with extra criterias

Same as number sorter, but:

. ArrayList<String> as input
. Criteria enum as second input parameter
. Enum should contain:
.. ASC for ascending sort
.. DESC for descending sort
.. NUM for numerical sort (non-numerical input is at the end of sorted ArrayList)
.. ALPH for alphabetical sort, first letters, then numbers
.. CODE for sorting by code points, 

CAUTION: input being list of strings means you are operating on words, despite the NumberSorter in the title!
