You are expected to read these papers and go through mandatory courses.

== About me

image::lafk_pl.png[]

WARNING: I pour a lot into each training. I also expect a lot. This will be hard work folks.


== Training

Will be rooted in practice.
Begins on Monday, at 10:00AM. 6th February 2017.
You will get a calendar invite for every part of the program.

=== Spirit of the training

From the 2001 book Art & Fear:

    The ceramics teacher announced on opening day that he was dividing the class into two groups. All those on the left side of the studio, he said, would be graded solely on the quantity of work they produced, all those on the right solely on its quality. His procedure was simple: on the final day of class he would bring in his bathroom scales and weigh the work of the “quantity” group: fifty pound of pots rated an “A”, forty pounds a “B”, and so on. Those being graded on “quality”, however, needed to produce only one pot — albeit a perfect one — to get an “A”.

    Well, came grading time and a curious fact emerged: the works of highest quality were all produced by the group being graded for quantity. It seems that while the “quantity” group was busily churning out piles of work — and learning from their mistakes — the “quality” group had sat theorizing about perfection, and in the end had little more to show for their efforts than grandiose theories and a pile of dead clay.

I do not wish to repeat the experiment, cause there's no merit. 
You will be graded by amount of code you do. Amount of tests you have. Make mistakes. Learn. Improve with each test.
Your way to quality goes through quantity, cause more quantity -> more feedback -> more learning -> more QUALITY.

== Prerequisites

CAUTION: Keep in mind, optional ones will help, but not as much as mandatory ones.

=== New to software testing?

Below you will find reading material from testers to wanna-be testers.

And tutorials to complete to have basic Java abilities.

And survey to fill so I can adjust training and tailor it for you.

=== QA automation - reading materials

Touches on aspects we won't be talking about enough (if at all). Also, gives you perspective and other sources to peruse material on your own.

First: forget the "best way to". Seriously.
